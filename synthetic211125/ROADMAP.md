<ins>Three Pad modes</ins>

The three buttons to the left of the pads change what the pads do:
- Pad mode: Touch a pad and it can play a note or send a MIDI message of some sort. The response can be defined from the front panel [p.42] or by using the MIDI
Control Center [p.61].
- Chord memory mode: Each pad stores a chord that can be played from that pad.
- Chord Transpose mode: Each pad stores a chord that can be played from the
keyboard. The Chord button must be lit to use Chord Transpose mode.
