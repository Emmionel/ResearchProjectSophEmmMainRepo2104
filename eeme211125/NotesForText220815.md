# Music Programming in Music Education

# What is SuperCollider?

SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.  It was launched by James McCartney in 1996.  Since 2003 SuperCollider is a fully open-source project and is further developed by a community of programmers.

SuperCollider is a dynamic programming language and provides a framework for acoustic research, algorithmic music, interactive programming and live coding.

Due to the fact that SuperCollider is open-source IDE and there is an evolving community around it one can easily find tutorials of its use and pre-existing examples of code that correspond to one's needs.

# why use music Programming in music education and sound Education?

Music programming affects both the process of composing/performing music itself and our understanding of the musical experience itself.

SuperCollider is an excellent tool for teaching programming.

<u> Benefits of use of SuperCollider </u>

1. Use of SuperCollider in order to explain sound parameters
2. processing of audio files in SuperCollider
3. sound synthesis/creation of SynthDefs

<u> Problems of use of SuperCollider </u>

1. In order to get
