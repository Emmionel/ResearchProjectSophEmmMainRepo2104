# Music Programming in Music Education

# What is SuperCollider?

SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.  It was launched by James McCartney in 1996.  Since 2003 SuperCollider is a fully open-source project and is further developed by a community of programmers.

SuperCollider is a dynamic programming language and provides a framework for acoustic research, algorithmic music, interactive programming and live coding.

# What are the parameters and conditions of music education with technology today?

The objectives that are set between music education and technology are based still on an elementary level and are not structed in an syllabus. Although digital technology has invaded our everyday life, knowledge of its principles is very limited amongst musicians. Ignorance of the principles of programming and digital technology is a hindrance to creativity when using music technology.

# Why use music Programming in music education and sound Education?

Music programming affects both the process of composing/performing music itself and our understanding of the musical experience itself.

# Benefits and advantages of SuperCollider as a tool for music education

Due to the fact that SuperCollider is open-source IDE and there is an evolving community around it one can easily find tutorials of its use and pre-existing examples of code that correspond to one's needs.

1. Use of SuperCollider in order to explain sound parameters
2. processing of audio files in SuperCollider
3. sound synthesis/creation of SynthDefs

# Difficulties presented by SuperCollider in education (prerequisites)

1. No-knowledge of English Language
2. No-knowledge of programming among music teachers and scholars
3. Lack of Equipment (Laptop, PC)
4. Lack of funding
5. Lack of time

# current problems in music Education (what is missing, what are the problems and what code can offer)

# what is the context of music education?

Music Education still focuses only on advancing on an music instrument and/or music theory.  

# Goal

*the use of SuperCollider in music practice and education and more specifically on the benefits of using code to explain concepts known from acoustics, music mathematics and digital sound processing in order to improve our understanding of the nature of musical sound*

*We propose a method based on finding, selecting examples of code and adapting and combining them with free experimentation in an improvisational manner. It is widely known that improvisation and experimentation are key factors in the development of the arts and sciences. The process described can be seen as a specific learning activity applied to music and digital technology (Activity theory as a potential framework for human-computer interaction research, Kuutti 1996).*

*how this comes together and ties in with the other requirements on the one hand and the remaining help from other courses on the other*

*where SuperCollider comes and goes, how it fits in with what is being said; where it can be beneficial to the goals being set; what are the arguments that motivate teachers to make an effort*

*what are the costs of the effort. what is the gain*
*activity learning. the process of play is close to the nature of the child, try and error*
