# <u> Paper title </u>: “The use of Music Programming in Music Education as a new teaching music method and its benefits”

## <u> Authors </u>: <em> Sophia Emmanouilidou, Iannis Zannos </em>

*This paper argues that composers/musicians/performers and, therefore, music teachers would be well advised to try to assimilate existing technological developments through the use of music programming. We consider as a candidate tool for this purpose SuperCollider. The article focuses on the use of SuperCollider in music practice and education and more specifically on the benefits of using code to explain concepts known from acoustics, music mathematics and digital sound processing in order to improve our understanding of the nature of musical sound. We propose a method based on finding, selecting examples of code and adapting and combining them with free experimentation in an improvisational manner. The process described can be seen as a specific learning activity applied to music and digital technology (Kuutti, 1996). Programming music with SuperCollider can be time-consuming because this programming environment offers many alternative ways to define musical and sound structures and to create interactive audio applications. Therefore, we emphasize the role of code reuse, i.e., adapting existing code examples to create new ones, as a tool to enrich the musical programming vocabulary (Plass et al., 2015). We examine how such examples can be found on the web and how they are adapted for educational and creative purposes. The experiences gained from experimenting with SuperCollider have given us convincing evidence that musical programming can open the door to musical creativity and exploration, and have given us a first insight into the potential of free open source software in education and artistic creation.*

# 1. What is the context of Μusic Εducation nowadays

The curriculum of Music Education nowadays still focuses only on advancing on an music instrument and/or music theory. Despite the fact that digital technology is a part of our everyday life we are still very skeptical about its use in music education. This ignorance can be considered as a hindrance to creativity and to the needs of our music society nowadays.

# 2. The parameters and conditions of Μusic Εducation with Τechnology today

Αs a student and then as a music teacher in various institutions (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Ionian University, Ano's Polis Concervatoire, PIVT institutions etc) I examined the curriculum in music education with technology today and made the following observations:

<u> Music Technology in today's curriculum consists on the below subjects:</u>
- use of a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software (Ableton, Cubase or Logic mostly)
- Use of Sound Effects on DAWs
- Use of EQ (Equalization) on DAWs
- Audio Interface of Sound Cards and Converters
- ADC (Analog to Digital Convertion) and vice versa
- Audio Editing & Audio Restoration Software
- DJing Software
- MIDI protocol
- Mastering of Audio on DAWs
- Mix and Mastering
- Auxilaries and Routing
- Monitoring
- Noise Cancelation
- Recording processing
- Explanation of various microphones and their use
- Synthesizers
- Samplers

<u>In the above list I miss the following subjects:</u>
- Music Programming
- Physics of sound
- Signal Processing with code
- Interactive Sound Systems
- Various Sensors
- Arduino and Raspberry Pi
- Processing analysis mindset
- Data processing
- Interactive Programming
- Live coding
- Acoustic Research
- Algorithmic Music

In the above curriculum we notice a clear focus on music production. Music production is the first step for one to understand the concept of music technology in terms of its economic and professional impact. However there exists another aspect of music technology besides its immediate application. Music programming is one of the most important factors that one should study in order to become more immersed in music technology. Engaging in music programming offers more benefits to the music student because it provides fundamental knowledge that is applicable to a wide variety of situations and contexts.

Although digital technology has invaded our everyday life, knowledge of its principles is very limited amongst musicians. Music programming can broad our horizons in many and various aspects.

# 3. Use of Music Programming in Music education and Sound Education

Music programming is the process in which a musician produces a sound or patch (McCartney, 2002). Music programming can be considered as a form of music production and performance using electronic devices and computer software so as to generate sounds of musical instruments (Magnusson, n.d.) or create his/her one.

Music programming affects both the process of composing/performing music itself and our understanding of the musical experience itself. Moreover, the use of music programming in music practice and education can give music teachers the opportunity to explain concepts known from acoustics, music mathematics and digital sound processing in order to improve our understanding of the nature of musical sound (Magnusson, n.d.).

Music education and thus music theory derives from the needs of music practices (performance and composition). Some of the most common practices of music programming in Music Composition and Performance are listed to the following list:

*προτάσεις οι οποίες είναι ερωτήματα*

*περιγραφικά και με παραδείγματα*

*καθαρή περιγραφή και απλοποιημένη*

<u> Music Programming in Music Composition and Performance </u>
- - Knowledge of Coding *παραδείγματα, ξεκινάω από αυτό*
- Sound Synthesis (SynthDefs)
- Realtime synthesis of sound
- Physical modelling of acoustic instruments
- Interactive sound Systems
- Performances based on sound
- Problem-solving mindset
- Selection and/or adaption of coding examples
- Acoustics of sound
- Mathematics of sound
- Experimentation and Improvisation with sound itself
- Data processing

If the above-mentioned aspects are included to music education, a whole new world of potentials is open for exploration. This paper claims that the SuperCollider IDE is a good tool for this purpose.

*ζητούμενα, προδιαγραφές και προβλήματα προς λύση. κατά πόσο η λύσεις μου ανταποκρίνονται στα ερωτήματα που έχω θέσει ως ζητούμενα*

# 4. What is SuperCollider

The whole concept of this paper is based on my personal experience learning how to use new technological advances in music performances and music education. We consider as a candidate tool for this purpose SuperCollider, a free open source software that is one of the most sophisticated and complete programming environments for sound and music. SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. (McCartney, n.d.) It was launched by James McCartney in 1996. Since 2003 SuperCollider is a fully open-source project and is further developed by a community of programmers. SuperCollider is a dynamic programming language and provides a framework for acoustic research, algorithmic music, interactive programming and live coding. Considering the above, one can easily understand that this environment opens up rich possibilities for new sounds and musical structures. This is vital for a composer/musician/performer living in today’s fast-paced society.

# 5. The advantages of using SuperCollider in Music Education

Due to the fact that SuperCollider is an open-source IDE and there is an evolving community around it one can easily find tutorials of its use and pre-existing examples of code that correspond to one's needs.

With SuperCollider one can synthesize one's sounds from scratch. Most DAWs do not give this oppurtunity to the user. The Supercollider can also process the audio signal and mix it as DAWs do. However, in the SuperCollider *rewrite* is this processing is done through the use of code. The general use code introduces us to processing analysis mindset and data processing, aspects that are known in computer sciences.

In music education SuperCollider enviroment allows to teacher to explain the sound parameters to his/her music students e.g. harmonics. Furthermore, in an more advanced level a music teacher can teach students the process of making their own interactive sound systems by connecting their created sounds to sensors and/or other hardware. Needless to say that the involvement with programming can be beneficial for learning other subjects too such as coding, computer sciences, English language, mathematics and physics.

# 6. Difficulties presented by SuperCollider in education (prerequisites)

Although SuperCollider can give us many opportunities and aspects of what music is and what music can be, there are some problematics that if not surpassed it may be difficult to comprehend.

<u>These problems are listed in the following list:</u>

1. No-knowledge of English Language
2. No-knowledge of programming among music teachers and scholars
3. Lack of Equipment (Laptop, PC)
4. Lack of funding
5. Lack of time

In spite the fact that all the above mention difficulties can be also considered as prerequisites in order for one to use SuperCollider, when one posses a laptop and/or PC and is willing to overcome partially some of these difficulties e.g. one's elementary level of English, a new whole world of potentials is unlocked. These problems can be also considered as difficulties of our fast-paced society. In order for one to be up to date with the existing trends in music and education one should strongly consider overcoming these problems.

# 7. A model scenario for introducing SuperCollider in Music Education

*ανάπτυξη και περιγραφή των bullets*

- as a tool that is used from the music teacher in order to explain sound parameters to students in music theory and harmony classes

- as an individual class in music technology section

# 8. Method

*correction starts from here*

To familiarize the music teacher with the use of music programming and specifically with the use of the SuperCollider we propose method based on finding, selecting examples of code and adapting and combining them with free experimentation in an improvisational manner. This process is free to the discretion of the music educator and is in accordance with the needs of the music lessons. It is widely known that improvisation and experimentation are key factors in the development of the arts and sciences. The process described can be seen as a specific learning activity applied to music and digital technology (Kuutti, 1996).

*how this comes together and ties in with the other requirements on the one hand and the remaining help from other courses on the other*

A similar procedure in specific contexts can be used by the music educator in order to teach the use of the SuperCollider as an individual course to the children. We propose the use of SuperCollider for children above the age of ten who they already have some courses of English Language. The use of SuperCollider in music education can be beneficial also for children in order to advance in other subjects such as physics, mathematics, English and coding. SuperCollider can be considered as an Interdisciplinary enviroment that combines all the former mentioned sciences together. This is a unique feature that is not offered by the common use of DAWs.

*where SuperCollider comes and goes, how it fits in with what is being said; where it can be beneficial to the goals being set; what are the arguments that motivate teachers to make an effort*

The method decribed can be considered as a try and error process. This process is essential for one in order to understand the depth of...

- processing analysis mindset
- activity learning. the process of play is close to the nature of the child, try and error*

*what are the costs of the effort. what is the gain*

Αlthough the procedure described is time-consuming and demanding on various fields (computer and English language skills required) if one surpasses these problems a whole new world of potentials is open for exploration. Engaging in musical programming can shape the way we think and therefore the way we perceive and create music.

- state of the art: what programming tools and what projects have or are introducing programming in music education

# 9. institutions and music schools that are willing to implement this educational scenario

The teaching method that was described above is going to be implemented in
"Ano's Polis Concervatoire" (Ano Poli/Thessaloniki, Greece) and in
Music School "Mousiko Karavi" (Oraiokastron/Thessaloniki, Greece).

We discussed to include SuperCollider in Music Theory lessons in order to explain the aspects of sound and harmonics. We also consider to teach SuperCollider seperately as an individual music course in the following academic years. This will be depedented on the general demand of this course in the above-mentioned music institutions.

# 10. Conclusions

*correction starts from here*

Considering all the above we strongly advocate that music programming should be a common practise in music performance and/or music theory nowadays and should also be tought as seperately as a course to all institutions that provide music education.

This proposed method will benefit music teachers as well as music students and thus will evolve our music perception and what music can be. Needless
