# <u> Paper title </u>: “The use of Music Programming in Music Education as a new teaching music method and its benefits”

## <u> Authors </u>: <em> Sophia Emmanouilidou, Iannis Zannos </em>

*This paper argues that composers/musicians/performers and, therefore, music teachers would be well advised to try to assimilate existing technological developments through the use of music programming. We consider as a candidate tool for this purpose SuperCollider. The article focuses on the use of SuperCollider in music practice and education and more specifically on the benefits of using code to explain concepts known from acoustics, music mathematics and digital sound processing in order to improve our understanding of the nature of musical sound. We propose a method based on finding, selecting examples of code and adapting and combining them with free experimentation in an improvisational manner. The process described can be seen as a specific learning activity applied to music and digital technology (Activity theory as a potential framework for human-computer interaction research, Kuutti 1996). Programming music with SuperCollider can be time-consuming because this programming environment offers many alternative ways to define musical and sound structures and to create interactive audio applications. Therefore, we emphasize the role of code reuse, i.e., adapting existing code examples to create new ones, as a tool to enrich the musical programming vocabulary (Foundations of game-based learning, Plass et al.2015). We examine how such examples can be found on the web and how they are adapted for educational and creative purposes. We propose that this process is comparable to the identification or formulation of software design patterns (Software Design Patterns, Gamma et al. 1994). The experiences gained from experimenting with SuperCollider have given us convincing evidence that musical programming can open the door to musical creativity and exploration, and have given us a first insight into the potential of free open source software in education and artistic creation.*

# What is SuperCollider

The whole concept of this paper is based on my personal experience learning how to use new technological advances in music performances and music education. We consider as a candidate tool for this purpose SuperCollider, a free open source software that is one of the most sophisticated and complete programming environments for sound and music. SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It was launched by James McCartney in 1996.  Since 2003 SuperCollider is a fully open-source project and is further developed by a community of programmers. SuperCollider is a dynamic programming language and provides a framework for acoustic research, algorithmic music, interactive programming and live coding. Cosidering the above, one can easily understand that this environment opens up rich possibilities for new sounds and musical structures. This is vital for a composer/musician/performer living in today’s fast-paced society.

# The parameters and conditions of music education with technology today

Αs a student and then as a music teacher in various instutuions (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Ionian University, Ano's Polis Concervatoire, PIVT institutions etc) I examined the curriculum in music education with technology today and made the following obesrvations:

<u> Music Technology in today's curriculum consists on the below subjects:</u>
- use of a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software (Ableton, Cubase or Logic mostly)
- Use of Sound Effects on DAWs
- Use of EQ (Equalization) on DAWs
- Audio Interface of Sound Cards and Converters
- ADC (Analog to Digital Convertion) and vice versa
- Audio Editing & Audio Restoration Software
- DJing Software
- MIDI protocol
- Mastering of Audio on DAWs
- Mix and Mastering
- Auxilaries and Routing
- Monitoring
- Noise Cancelation
- Recording processing
- Explanation of various microphones and their use
- Synthesizers
- Samplers

<u>In the above list I miss the following subjects:</u>
- Music Programming
- Physics of sound
- *Signal Processing* with code
- Interactive Sound Systems
- Various Sensors
- Arduino and Raspberry Pi
- Processing analysis mindset

In the above curriculum we notice a clear focus on music production. Music production is the first step for one to understand the concept of music technology in terms of its economic and proffesional impact. However there exists another aspect of music technology besides its immediate application. While it offers more benefits to the student because it provides fundamental knowledge, which is applicable in main different situations and contexts.

*introducing these aspects*   

Although digital technology has invaded our everyday life, knowledge of its principles is very limited amongst musicians. Music programming can broad our horizons in many and various aspects. Ignorance of the principles of programming and digital technology is a hindrance to creativity when using music technology.

# Use of music Programming in music education and sound Education

Music programming affects both the process of composing/performing music itself and our understanding of the musical experience itself. Moreover, the use of SuperCollider in music practice and education can give music teachers the oppotunity to explain concepts known from acoustics, music mathematics and digital sound processing in order to improve our understanding of the nature of musical sound (Physical Modelling, Magnusson n.d.).

- Benefits of music programming in music composition and performance

- Propising a method based on finding, selecting examples of code and adapting and combining them with free experimentation in an improvisational manner.

It is widely known that improvisation and experimentation are key factors in the development of the arts and sciences. The process described can be seen as a specific learning activity applied to music and digital technology (Activity theory as a potential framework for human-computer interaction research, Kuutti 1996).

# Benefits and advantages of SuperCollider as a tool for music education

Due to the fact that SuperCollider is open-source IDE and there is an evolving community around it one can easily find tutorials of its use and pre-existing examples of code that correspond to one's needs.

1. Use of SuperCollider in order to explain sound parameters
2. processing of audio files in SuperCollider
3. sound synthesis/creation of SynthDefs

# Difficulties presented by SuperCollider in education (prerequisites)

1. No-knowledge of English Language
2. No-knowledge of programming among music teachers and scholars
3. Lack of Equipment (Laptop, PC)
4. Lack of funding
5. Lack of time

# current problems in music Education (what is missing, what are the problems and what code can offer)

Although all the above metion difficulties can be also cosidered as prerequisites in order for one to use SuperCollider, when one posses a laptop and/or PC and is willing to overcome partially some of these difficulties e.g. one's elementary level of English, a new whole world of potentials is unlocked.  

# what is the context of music education?

Music Education still focuses only on advancing on an music instrument and/or music theory.  

# Method

*We propose a method based on finding, selecting examples of code and adapting and combining them with free experimentation in an improvisational manner. It is widely known that improvisation and experimentation are key factors in the development of the arts and sciences. The process described can be seen as a specific learning activity applied to music and digital technology (Activity theory as a potential framework for human-computer interaction research, Kuutti 1996).*

*how this comes together and ties in with the other requirements on the one hand and the remaining help from other courses on the other*

*where SuperCollider comes and goes, how it fits in with what is being said; where it can be beneficial to the goals being set; what are the arguments that motivate teachers to make an effort*

*what are the costs of the effort. what is the gain*
*activity learning. the process of play is close to the nature of the child, try and error*

# a model scenario for introducing supercollider in music Education

use of pre-existing code examples

# institutions and music schools that are willing to implement this educational scenario

The teaching method that was described above is going to be implemented in
Ano's Polis Concervatoire (Ano Poli/Thessaloniki, Greece) and in
Music School "Mousiko Karavi" (Oraiokastron/Thessaloniki, Greece)
