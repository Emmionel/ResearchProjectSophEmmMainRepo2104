This paper is about embracing music programming in music practices and music education in general. The paper centers on the use of SuperCollider in music practices and education and more specifically on the benefits of using code in order to explain sound parameters and in music. We discuss the benefits of music programming in music composition and performance. We show how music programming impacts both the process of music composition/performance itself and our understanding and perception of what music is or can become. Firstly, ….
This process can be time-consuming because one has so many ways for shaping his/her own sound in SuperCollider. When working at an elementary level one that cannot have the flexibility to write his/her own code can use also existing examples on the internet regarding synth code (SynthDefs) or can use audio files. Once this first problem is solved, then experimentation on the sound itself and the over dubbing of different sound synths in on. The above-mentioned process is the key for learning and developing efficiently the practices of music programming into music teaching methods. One may say that improvisation and experimentation are key factors for further development of all the arts and sciences. SuperCollider and music programming in general can open the door to creativity and exploration. This is crucial for a composer/musician/performer living in our fast-paced society.
….
Technology dominates a great amount of our everyday life but however we use music technology and music programming in a very scrupulous manner. The present paper advocates that composers/musicians/performers and, therefore, music teachers try to embrace the existing technological advances through the usage of music programming in SuperCollider, in because this opens up an enormous potential for new sounds.
